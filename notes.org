This page contains a list of todo items for this website. It is
probably of no interest to anyone except myself.

* TODO [#B] Migrate all posts from https://sputnikdev.wordpress.com

  This is my old blog from days gone by, when I dealt with the joys of
  .NET. I am gradually moving them to this website, which is a
  reasonably quick process now.

  My son is after a blog ... let's use it as an example. He'll love me
  for it, teaching hime emacs and all that :)

  Write a script that retrieves all tags from the files and creates an
  index of all articles as a page with the tags as headings and the
  links as a list under each heading.
