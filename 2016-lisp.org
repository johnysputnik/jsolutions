#+TITLE: Language for 2016 - Common Lisp

* Introduction

  I have chosen common lisp as my language to learn in more depth for
  2016 as I have dabbled with it over the past year or so, along with
  clojure, another very good lisp based language.

  I chose common lisp as a language as I prefer the syntax over
  clojure and because I believe it should be able to produce more
  efficient code as well as being able to produce stand alone binary
  files without the dependence on the JVM that clojure has.

  I have no specific plan as to how this learning will pan out, other
  than I intend to dive a bit deeper than I have done in the past.

  The tools I use for this learning are SBCL and GNU Emacs with
  Slime. This is all running under OS-X El Capitan on a Macbook pro.

  The complete source code for this article can be found [[file:2016-lisp.lisp][here]] and the
  article formatted as PDF [[file:2016-lisp.pdf][here]]. The org-mode file used to generate
  this web page and the lisp code can be found [[file:2016-lisp.org][here]].

  Some books I have on lisp can be found [[file:books.org::*Lisp][here]].

  I have inter-dispersed larger examples through the code that
  hopefully build on the sections that have preceded.

* An Overview of Common Lisp Syntax

  Common lisp has a simple syntax for processing lists delimited by '('
  and ')'. The lisp processes a list by applying the the first item in
  the list as an operator and the rest as operands. Lists can be
  nested:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp +n -r 
;; Comments can be added using a semi colon
(+
 (* 3 4)
 (+ 2 3))
#+END_SRC
  This code applies operand '+' to the result of applying operand '*'
  to 3 and 4, and the result of applying operand '+' to 2 and 3.

  A list can be created as a just list of data, by using the 'quote'
  operand or by using a shortcut single quote, the following are both
  equivalent:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp +n -r
  ;; The following lines are equivalent
  (equal (quote (1 2 3 4))
         '(1 2 3 4))
  ;; => T
#+END_SRC

  More details on collections can be found in [[*Collections][Collections]].

  String are, like most languages, delimited with double quotes.
  
  Backslashes are used as escape characters, much like other
  languages. However, the use of a vertical bar allows special
  characters to be used without escaping:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp +n -r
  ;; The following items in the list are equivalent
  (equal 'A\(B\) '|A(B)|)
  ;; => T
#+END_SRC

  A hash symbol is a macro symbol, known as the dispatching macro
  character. There are many of these, for example:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp +n -r
  ;; #' - function abbreviation
  ;; #\ - character object
  ;; ,#+ - read-time conditional
  ;; #c - complex number
  ;; #( - vector
#+END_SRC

  More details can be found in [[*Macro%20Dispatching%20Characters][Macro Dispatching Characters]].

  A back quote can be used to allow a template to be used when
  generating code, with a comma used to evaluate a form and an '@'
  symbol used to splice a list into the template, for example:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp +n -r
  (defparameter x '(a b c))
  ;; x
  `(x)
  ;; => (x)
  `(,x)
  ;; => ((a b c))
  `(,@x)
  ;; => (a b c)
  `(x ,x ,@x foo ,(cadr x) bar ,(cdr x) baz ,@(cdr x))
  ;; => (x (a b c) a b c foo b bar (b c) baz b c)
#+END_SRC

  This is used extensively when writing macros. For more information
  on macros see [[*Macros][Macros]].

  Colons are used in 2 situations. Firstly it can be used to indicate
  the package in which a symbol is defined:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp +n -r
  ;; reset is a symbol in the network package
  ;; (network:reset)
#+END_SRC

  Packages are discussed in [[*Packages][Packages]].

  It can also be used to denote a keyword, which is a symbol that
  always evaluates to itself and is constant. For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp +n -r
  (eql ':foo :foo)
  ;; => T
#+END_SRC

  Keywords are interned in the package KEYWORD and are automatically
  exported from it:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp +n -r
  (eql keyword:foo :foo)
  ;; => T
#+END_SRC

* Example 1 - Sum of Square Errors

  An equation that is used in regression algorithms is the sum of
  the square of errors for a given dataset and function being fitted
  to the data.

  Given a data set of size $m$ with a single input variable $x$ and a
  single output value $y$ for each item in the data set
  and a function that is an attempt to fit a function to the values:

  $$y = f(x)$$

  Then an error can be calculated based on the sum of the square of
  the individual errors, giving an estimate of how well fitted the
  function is to the date:

  $$E = \sum_{n=0}^m(f(x_n) - y_n)^2$$
  
  Using lisp, we can write some code that takes a data set, computes
  the error based on several functions:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp +n -r -l ";(%s)" :exports both
  ;; First declare some data
  ;;
  (defparameter data '((0.1 . 1.1)
                       (0.9 . 3.2)
                       (2.1 . 5.9)
                       (3.2 . 7.2)
                       (3.9 . 9.0)
                       (5.1 . 11.2)))                                   ;(data-1)

  ;; then some equations
  ;;
  (defparameter equation-list
    (list #'(lambda (x) (+ 1 (* 2 x)))
          #'(lambda (x) (+ 1 (* x x)))
          #'(lambda (x) (+ 1 x))))                                       ;(eqn-1)

  ;; now create a function that applies a function
  ;; to a set of input data
  ;;
  (defun apply-function (f d)
    (map 'list #'(lambda (x) (funcall f (car x))) d))                  ;(apply-1)

  ;; A function that returns the error as the difference
  ;; between two values squared
  ;;
  (defun square-error (test-data calc-data)                               ;(sq-1)
    (expt (- test-data calc-data) 2))

  ;; A function that returns the sum of square errors
  ;; of a collection of data and the results
  ;;
  (defun sum-square-error (f test-data)                                ;(sumsq-1)
    (reduce #'+
            (map 'list
                 #'(lambda (test calc)
                     (square-error (cdr test) calc))
                 test-data (apply-function f test-data))))

  ;; Now we can run the sum of square errors across all equations
  ;;
  (map 'list #'(lambda (eq) (sum-square-error eq data))               ;(output-1)
       equation-list)
#+END_SRC
#+RESULTS:
| 0.7400005 | 320.44208 | 61.350002 |

The [[(data-1)][data]] is defined as a set of cons cells with the car equal to an x
value and the cdr equal to a y value. This is the test data that will
be used to check the equations. It uses defparameter, but could
equally be defined inline at [[(output-1)][Line (output-1)]].

The [[(eqn-1)][equations]] are defined as a list of lambda functions modeling the
following equations for fitting to the data:

$y=2x+1$

$y=x^2+1$

$y=x+1$

Again, these could have been defined inline at the point of use. 

The [[(apply-1)][apply-function]] function takes a function as an argument and a
collection of data as an alist and executes the function taking the
car of each item in the alist as the x value to calculate the y value.

The [[(sq-1)][square-error]] function takes a single test data y value and a
single calculated value and calculates the square of the error.

The [[(sumsq-1)][sum-square-error]] function takes a function f and applies the
[[sq-1][square-error]] function to each item in the test data and the
corresponding calculated output as calculated by the function f.

The [[(output-1)][output]] is generated by applying the  [[(sumsq-1)][sum-square-error]] function to
each equation using the test data.

It can clearly be seen from both the results of the sum of square
errors and the input data that eqn1 is the best fit.

To confirm this we can plot the data:

#+tblname: example1-plot-data
|   x | data | eqn1 |  eqn2 | eqn3 |
|-----+------+------+-------+------|
| 0.1 |  1.1 |  1.3 |  1.01 |  1.1 |
| 0.9 |  3.2 |  2.8 |  1.81 |  1.9 |
| 2.1 |  5.9 |  5.2 |  5.41 |  3.1 |
| 3.2 |  7.2 |  7.4 | 11.24 |  4.2 |
| 3.9 |  9.0 |  8.8 | 16.21 |  4.9 |
| 5.1 | 11.2 | 11.2 | 27.01 |  6.1 |

using this gnuplot script:

#+BEGIN_SRC gnuplot :exports both :var data=example1-plot-data :file example1-plot.png

#+END_SRC
#+RESULTS:

* Core functions
  - cons

    cons is used to construct lists, it puts a new element at the end
    of the list, or can be used for creating a pair:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp +n -r
  (cons 1 3)
  ;; => (1 . 3)
  (cons 3 nil)
  ;; => (3)
  (cons 5 '(1 2 3 4))
  ;; => (5 1 2 3 4)
#+END_SRC

  - car

    Given a list car retrieves the first item in a list:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp +n -r
  (car '(1 2 3 4))
  ;; => 1
#+END_SRC

  - cdr

    Given a list cdr retrieves the remaining list after the first
    element

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp +n -r
  (cdr '(1 2 3 4))
  ;; => (2 3 4)
#+END_SRC

  - cadr / cddr etc

    These can be nested to various levels for example:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp +n -r
  (cadr '(1 2 3 5))
  ;; => 2
  (cddr '(1 2 3 4))
  ;; => (3 4)
#+END_SRC
  
  - lambda

    lambda is used to create a function special form involving a
    lambda expression. The expression takes a lambda list and a form
    and returns a function:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp +n -r
  (lambda (x) (+ 1 x))
  ;; => #<FUNCTION (LAMBDA (X)) {10035B665B}>
#+END_SRC
    
  - funcall

    Funcall is used to call a function, which can be created with a
    lambda.  However it becomes more useful when passing lambda expressions or
    functions as arguments (a little convoluted):

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp +n -r
  (funcall (lambda (x) (+ 1 x)) 3)
  ;; => 4

  (defun do-something (x a)
    (funcall x a))
  (do-something (lambda (x) (+ 1 x)) 2)
  ;; => 3
#+END_SRC

  - function

    With the function function we can return a function from a
    function! This can be used to create a form of partial functions:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp +n -r
  (defun multiplier (n)
    (function (lambda (x) (* x n))))

  (funcall (multiplier 3) 4)
  ;; => 12

  (defun doubler (n)
    (funcall (multiplier 2) n))

  (doubler 10)
  ;; => 20
#+END_SRC

  - apply

    The apply function is very similar to funcall, except it takes a
    list as an argument. This means that it can be used when the
    number of arguments is unknown at compile time.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp +n -r
  (apply #'+ 100 '(4 5 6 7))
  ;; => 122
  (defun add-to-ten (&rest args)
    (apply #'+ 10 args))
  (add-to-ten 1 2 3 4 5)
  ;; => 25
#+END_SRC

  - read

    The read function reads a single s-expression, skipping whitespace
    and comments and returns the lisp object denoted by the
    s-expression.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp +n -r
  ;; given a file code.lisp containing
  ;;
  ;; (1 2 3)
  ;; 456
  ;; "a string" ; this is a comment
  ;; ((a b)
  ;;  (c d))
  ;;
  (defparameter *s* (open "code.lisp"))
  ;; => *S*
  (read *s*)
  ;; => (1 2 3)
  (read *s*)
  ;; => 456
  (read *s*)
  ;; => "a string"
  (read *s*)
  ;; ((A B) (C D))
  (close *s*)
  ;; => T
#+END_SRC

  - eval

    The eval function just evaluates a lisp expression. It is used in
    combination with read to execute lisp expressions:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp +n -r
  (eval (+ 1 2))
  ;; => 3
  ;; given a file code.lisp with a line
  ;; (+ 1 2)
  (defparameter *s* (open "code.lisp"))
  (eval (read *s*))
  ;; => 3
#+END_SRC
    
  - print

    The print function prints the representation of a lisp object.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp +n -r
  (print 2)
  ;; 2
  ;; => 2
  (print (eval (+ 1 2)))
  ;; 3
  ;; => 3
#+END_SRC

  - cond

    The primary conditional statement in lisp is the cond function:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp +n -r
  (defun get-type-name (a)
    (cond ((null a) "null")
          ((atom a) "atom")
          ((listp a) "list")
          (t "unknown")))
  (get-type-name nil)
  ;; => "null"
  (get-type-name 1)
  ;; => "atom"
  (get-type-name '(1))
  ;; => "list"
#+END_SRC

  - quote

    The quote function is described [[*An%20Overview%20of%20Common%20Lisp%20Syntax][above]].

  - atom
    
    The atom function is outlined [[*Atoms][below]].

  - null

    The null function determines if a symbol is nil:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp +n -r
  (null nil)
  ;; => T
  (null 1)
  ;; => nil
  (null '())
  ;; => T
#+END_SRC

  - set, setf and setq

    set is the original lisp function. setf is a shorthand function
    meaning set field and setq a shorthand function meaning
    set quote. One can think of set as setting value of symbols and
    setf as setting the value of variables. setf is a macro allowing
    various setting of things.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp +n -r
  ;; The following are all equivalent
  (set (quote *foo*) 42)
  (setf (symbol-value '*foo*) 42)
  (set '*foo* 42)
  (setq *foo* 42)
  ;; assigning to data structure
  (setf (car x) 42)
  ;; some more examples
  (set ls '(1 2 3 4))   ;; ERROR ls has no value
  (set 'ls '(1 2 3 4))  ;; OK
  (setq ls '(1 2 3 4))  ;; OK
  (setf ls '(1 2 3 4))  ;; OK
  (setf (car ls) 10)    ;; ls -> '(10 2 3 4)
#+END_SRC

  - defvar and defparameter

    defvar and defparameter are very similar, both bind a value to a
    name. the difference is that defvar only binds the value if it is
    not already bound. However, the value can still be changed with
    setq:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp +n -r
  (defvar *s* 2)
  ;; => *S*
  ,*s*
  ;; => 2
  (defvar *s* 3)
  ,*s*
  ;; => 2
  (setq *s* 3)
  ,*s*
  ;; => 3
  (defparameter *t* 2)
  ,*t*
  ;; => 2
  (defparameter *t* 3)
  ,*t*
  ;; =>3
#+END_SRC

  - defconstant

    defconstant is similar to defparameter and defvar, except the
    value cannot be changed.

  - defun

    defun defines a function that can be called from other parts of
    code. They are the primary abstraction mechanism in lisp and are
    described [[*Functions][below]].

  - defmacro

    defmacro is used to define macros that are evaluated during
    compilation, they are discussed [[*Macros][below]].

  - equality predicates

    There are several equality operators in lisp that perform
    different functions:

    (eq x y) is true if and only if x and y are identical objects.

    (eql x y) is true if (eq x y) or x and y are numbers of the same
    type and have the same value, or are character objects that
    represent the same character.

    (equal x y) is true if x and y are structurally similar
    (isomorphic). It is often the case that x and y will have the same
    printed representation.

    (equalp x y) is true if (equal x y) is true or for numbers they
    have the same value even if they are different types or for
    characters that are equal but different case. For collections,
    (equalp x y) is true if equalp is true for every element in the
    collection.

* Data Structures
** Atoms
   Atoms are things that are not cons cells, and can be tested using
   the atom predicate:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp +n -r
(atom 1)
;; => T
(atom :test)
;; => T
(atom nil)
;; => T
(atom '())
;; => T
#+END_SRC

   However, they are not things that cannot be broken down any further:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp +n -r
(atom "text")
;; => T
(atom #(1 2 3))
;; => T
#+END_SRC

   Symbols are atoms as well:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp +n -r
(defun test-atomicity (x) (atom x))
(atom 'test-atomicity)
;; => T
#+END_SRC

   And lambda expressions:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp +n -r
(atom (lambda (x) (atom x)))
;; => T
#+END_SRC

   Examples of some things that are not atoms:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp +n -r
(atom '(1 . 3))
;; => NIL
(atom '(1 2 3))
;; => NIL
(atom (cdr '(1 2 3)))
;; => NIL
#+END_SRC

** Sequences
   Sequences are ordered lists of elements and can be manipulated by a
   variety of standard sequence functions. A sequence is either a
   vector or a list. Vectors are one dimensional arrays and Lists are
   linked lists made up of cons cells and are discussed [[*Lists][here]].

*** Arrays and Vectors
    - simple array

      Arrays are simple multi dimensional lists of fixed size with
      elements that are arranged sequentially, rather than as a linked
      list in the case of lisp lists:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp +n -r
  ;; creates a 3 dimensional array with 10 elements in each dimensional
  (defparameter *array* (make-array '(10 10 10)))
  ;; creates an array with all elements initialised to 23
  (defparameter *23-array* (make-array '(10 10) :initial-element 23))
  ;; initialise with content
  (defparameter *fib* (make-array '(5) :initial-contents '(1 2 3 5 8)))
  ;; set a value of an array element
  (setf (aref *23-array* 5 5) 7)
  ;; an array with room for 2 elements, resizeable but empty
  (defparameter *resizeable* (make-array '(2) :fill-pointer 0 :adjustable t))
  (vector-push 'a *resizeable*)
  (vector-push 'b *resizeable*)
  (vector-push-extend 'c *resizeable*)
  *resizeable*
  ;; => #(A B C)
  (vector-pop *resizeable*)
  *resizeable*
  ;; => #(A B)
  (adjust-array *resizeable* '(2))
#+END_SRC

    - bit vector

      Bit vector are efficient containers for bits that can be
      manipulated with bitwise operations:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp +n -r
  (bit-and #*1101000101000101 #*0100100010100101)
  ;; = > #*0100000000000101
#+END_SRC
