<h2 id="sec-1">Setting The Scene</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
A team has recently adopted scrum, they have both test and development
resources from a previous test team and various development teams. The
team is just starting to sprint, it’s estimated the backlog, which has
been nicely prioritised by the PO and it is now ready for it’s first
sprint, it even has a nicely coloured board ready:
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="slide1.png" alt="slide1.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
The developers reckon they can get through about 7 stories, which
are conveniently all the same size. Testing reckon they can cope
with this, so the sprint backlog is created:
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="slide2.png" alt="slide2.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
The sprint starts and development get on with some tasks, test sit
in anticipation of some work:
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="slide3.png" alt="slide3.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
As the sprint goes on, development hands over to test and picks up
some more items from the sprint backlog, they are getting through
this faster than they thought:
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="slide4.png" alt="slide4.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Testing start to get their teeth into the work, they quickly get
through a couple of stories, which are signed off as Done by the
PO. Smiles all round as business value is delivered. Even better,
development are storming through work and have some spare time at
the end of the sprint. a few more high priority stories are brought
in. Testing recognise they probably need to up their speed to keep
up, but everyone is encouraged to see how fast the work is getting
completed:
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="slide5.png" alt="slide5.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Development finish their stories just in time for the sprint to end,
test have completed another 2 stories which have been signed off by
the PO. However, they have a queue of 5 incomplete items. The
velocity is 4 stories.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="slide6.png" alt="slide6.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
At the retrospective the developers are patted on the back, the
testers are as well, but it is acknowledged that they are a bottle
neck and testing needs to somehow be made more efficient. Testing
say they will endeavour to clear their queue before development
start throwing work over the fence. The sprint backlog is created,
taking in 4 stories as this is the velocity from the previous
sprint. There is a bit of confusion from the developers around how
many should be taken into the sprint, but it is agreed that more can
be added if neccessary later on:
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="slide7.png" alt="slide7.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
So development start on the stories and test start on their existing
queue:
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="slide8.png" alt="slide8.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Development are still steaming through work, so no sooner have test
completed a couple of stories, they have 3 more. Development are sat
twiddling their thumbs, so it is agreed that they may as well take
on some more work, what does it matter if test have a queue, as long
as work is coming out Done at the other end in a predictable manner?
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="slide9.png" alt="slide9.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Test are starting to get a bit hacked off, pressure is on them to
work faster and cut corners. Development may be steaming through
work and doing more than expected, but test is feeling a bit
isolated as developers take more stories and throw yet more over the
fence:
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="slide10.png" alt="slide10.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Finally, the sprint ends. Test have only managed to get 1 story done
from the current sprint and have 8 in their queue of work. Velocity
is up to 6:
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="slide11.png" alt="slide11.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
The situation has hit a major problem, test is only 2/3 of the
capacity of development, but it has only taken 2 sprints for them to
be a whole sprint behind
</p>

<p>
Time for a major retrospective
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">What happened</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
The sprint has ended, velocity is up so the PO is happy…. ish!
Things are clearly not right. Here are my thoughts
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-1">One Team</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
The team is still suffering from a legacy view of development and
test. The two teams are not only seen as operating in 2 separate
phases of development, but are also treated
differently. Development is driving the sprint more than test. Test
are feeling development are just throwing work at them and it is
also clear that development are being viewed by the PO and the
business as a separate team that is somehow more of a success than
testing. This is the first point that would need
addressing. Development and test are not separate teams, but the
same team.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-2">Multi Disciplined Team and Members</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
Testers and Developers, whilst having specific skills and strengths
should both be involved with testing and development. The team
should be multi-disciplined and the team members should be
multi-disciplined. In this case, development, perhaps, should have
been involved with assisting testing, perhaps helping to automate
the testing and improve the efficiency as a whole, which leads to:
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-3">Inspect and Adapt</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
There is a problem in that testing is taking longer than expected,
why is this? what barriers are there? what can be automated, what
distractions are getting in the way? How can team resource be best
used in the sprint?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-4">Ad-hoc testing by PO?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-4">
<p>
The PO is ulitmately responsible for accepting stories as Done,
perhaps the PO could do ad-hoc testing after acceptance criteria
have been met?
