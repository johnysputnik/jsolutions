<p>
Recently a <a href="http://williamedwardscoder.tumblr.com/post/20054342100/agile-is-a-sham">blog article</a> was posted by William Edwards, outlining
quite harshly why he felt that agile, or should I say Agile, was not
only a waste of time but not conducive to producing good
software. There are a significant amount of responses to his post so
I’d thought I’d put mine here.
</p>

<h2 id="sec-2">How Agile can Hinder</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
A lot of theory for agile process methodology comes from
manufacturing, especially kanban. They are all generally geared
towards maximising throughput. But when the workers are people
rather than machines there is a danger that the process becomes all
about grinding out features at any cost. If this becomes the focus
it is almost certainly going to lead to demoralisation and burn out.
</p>

<p>
However, this is a symptom of a top down imposed agile process, where
management hear the benefits of increased throughput and efficiency
and presume it will solve problems of lack of productivity. Expecting
this of any process is perhaps a bit shortsighted.
</p>

<p>
Scrum, in particular, also has a focus on all team members being equal
in role, and can design, develop and test with equal
responsibility. There is an obvious danger in this which is
highlighted in the post, that specific individual expertise may be
lost amongst the levelling of skills in a team. Some even argue that
scrum is a process for mediocre teams as there is no room for experts.

<p>
Having read the article, I am a little unclear on the alternative
that the author is suggesting as he seems to imply that agile is
always wrong and his way is always right, I am sure that is not
exactly what he intended to imply. However, as some of the replies
suggest, any process has to be geared around the
project/individual/customer circumstances. If the environment is one
where priorities and requirements are changing and timescales are
short, then adopting an iterative framework like Scrum may be more
appropriate than a model that encourages a lot of up front
requirements gathering and design. Not all projects are like that
and no process can be globally appropriate.
</p>

<p>
I believe that Scrum can be said to have succeeded when one no longer
needs a scrummaster and maybe even Scrum itself  is no longer
followed. Just as deleting code is often more beneficial than writing
code, removing process is often more beneficial than adding
process. Scrum, like most other agile processes or frameworks
encourages everyone, in particular the team to constantly inspect and
adapt itself to do better, whatever ‘better’ may mean, which may not
always be about just increasing throughput.

<div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">Summary</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
Team A is in a situation where it is delivering good software
reliably to the customer, the business is making good margins on the
product and the team enjoys working on it and generally all parties
are happy,  it shouldn’d need to look for any process to adopt, the
one it currently follows, even if only by implication obviously
works perfectly.
</p>

<p>
However, this is very rare indeed and in Team B there are problems
with delivering reliable software, profit margins and developer
satisfaction, something needs to be done and using a framework such
as Scrum to encourage everyone to uncover problems, inspect
processes and practices and adapt to improve the situation is a good
thing.
</p>

<p>
Ultimately Team B is aiming to be like the idealistic Team A and an
agile approach may help this.
