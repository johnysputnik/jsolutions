<h2 id="orgbd0b372">Agile Development</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgbd0b372">
<p>
In the late 1990s, several development methodologies started to
appear in response to the inevitable requirements churn in most
software project requirements. They emphasised close communication
between the engineering team, the business and users and an ability
to respond quickly and deliver value frequently and predictably.
</p>

<p>
At a summit of a small group of practitioners of these methodologies
a consensus on the principles and values that sum up what it means
to be Agile was composed; the now famous Agile Manifesto:
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org3956a45" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org3956a45">The Manifesto for Agile Software Development</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3956a45">
<p>
We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it
and helping others do it.
</p>

<p>
Through this work we have come to value:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools</li>
<li>Working software over comprehensive documentation</li>
<li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation</li>
<li>Responding to change over following a plan</li>
</ul>

<p>
That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value
the items on the left more.
</p>

<p>
Supplementing this was the principles of agile development:
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org90fa8c5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org90fa8c5">The Twelve Principles of Agile Software</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org90fa8c5">
<p>
We follow these principles:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early
and continuous delivery of valuable software.</li>
<li>Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile
processes harness change for the customer’s competitive
advantage.</li>
<li>Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a
couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.</li>
<li>Business people and developers must work together daily
throughout the project.</li>
<li>Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the
environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job
done.</li>
<li>The most efficient and effective method of conveying information
to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.</li>
<li>Working software is the primary measure of progress.</li>
<li>Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors,
developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace
indefinitely.</li>
<li>Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
enhances agility.</li>
<li>Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is
essential.</li>
<li>The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from
self-organizing teams.</li>
<li>At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more
effective, then tunes and adjusts its behaviour accordingly.</li>
</ol>

<p>
It is from these principles that Agile processes, practices and
frameworks such as Scrum and XP have developed.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org4824c07" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org4824c07">Lean Principles</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4824c07">
<p>
While the Agile Manifesto is a result of a consolidation of what was
starting to happen in software engineering, Lean development
principles came as a result of adapting and applying principles
borrowed from Lean Manufacturing. Lean Manufacturing was centred on
“Preserving Value with Less Work” and came from ideas and philosophy
that had been developed by Toyota in Japan.
</p>

<p>
Lean development can be summarised by seven principles:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Eliminate Waste. Everything that is not adding value for the
customer should be considered waste. This includes time delays
and unnecessary features and process.</li>
<li>Amplify Learning. Short iterations encourage rapid feedback. This
helps the team and the customer learn about their product and
process quickly.</li>
<li>Decide as late as possible. As software development is always
carried out with some uncertainty. Decisions should be delayed
until they can be made on facts not assumptions. The capacity for
change should be built into a system.</li>
<li>Deliver as fast as possible. The sooner a product is delivered
the sooner feedback can be obtained and the sooner value can be
realised by the customer.</li>
<li>Empower the team. Find good people and let them decide how to do
their job.</li>
<li>Build integrity in. Simplicity, Clarity, Minimal features
resulting from refactoring continuously. Continuous integration
of features should include thorough testing to verify the
integrity.</li>
<li>See the whole. Ensure communication between teams developing
different components of a system to encourage an understanding of
interactions between components.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Lean thinking can be summarised by: “Think big, act small, fail
fast, learn rapidly”
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org3d4529b" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org3d4529b">Scrum</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3d4529b">
<p>
Scrum is a popular process framework based on short iterations of
development known as sprints; its primary principle is Inspect and
Adapt, a direct response to thinking in a lean way. It is the
recognition that we need to learn as we have gaps in our knowledge
about the product. It is the acknowledgement that we need to fail
fast, but in relation to small actions. It is also the point at
which waste can be identified and eliminated.
</p>

<p>
Inspect and Adapt is also a response to the agile principle of
responding to change over following a plan. Inspection and
adaptation is important enough in scrum to have a dedicated meeting
every Sprint, the Retrospective.
</p>

<p>
The short iteration cycle, or Sprint, allows for a lot of the Lean
principles to be applied, including delivering fast, deciding late
and amplifying learning. In scrum, the Team is empowered to decide
how it wants to work and integrity is encouraged by having
multi-disciplined team members with an ability to develop and test.
</p>

<p>
The Daily Scrum, a point at which all team members notify each other
of work done, work in progress and impediments applies the principle
of Individuals and Interactions over process and tools and the
Sprint Planning and Sprint Review encourage Customer Collaboration
via the Product Owner, who is the customer representative to the
Team.
</p>

<p>
In a scrum project a Scrummaster is often in place, not as a project
manager but rather a mentor and coach to encourage the Inspect and
Adapt principle and help remove any impediments external to the
Team.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org148990d" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org148990d">Process</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org148990d">
<p>
The Scrum process is a relatively simple one, as shown below:
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="scrum.png" alt="scrum.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
The product is defined by a list of User Stories held in a Product
Backlog. This is managed by the Product Owner.
</p>

<p>
Sprint Planning is carried out to determine, based on the Team’s
throughput, known as Velocity, how much can be taken into the Sprint
Backlog. Once this has been agreed by the Team, the Sprint, a fixed
development iteration, can start.
</p>

<p>
As the Sprint goes on, every morning the Team will inform each other
of work done, work in progress and Impediments in the Daily Scrum.
</p>

<p>
Once the Sprint is finished, the User Stories are demo’d to the
Product Owner by the Team in the Sprint Review. The Product Owner
then agrees which User Stories are done and removes them from the
Product Backlog The total value of Effort for the done User Stories
in the Sprint makes up the Team’s Velocity.
</p>

<p>
The Sprint is completed and the Team now hold a Retrospective where
they discuss and identify what is going well, what is going badly,
how to get the most out of what is going well and address what is
going badly.
</p>

<p>
The Velocity, Product Backlog and actions from the Retrospective are
all brought to the table again in the Sprint Planning to plan the
next Sprint.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orge36fc27" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orge36fc27">Roles</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge36fc27">
<p>
There are 3 roles in the Scrum Process:
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orga28b723" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orga28b723">Team</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orga28b723">
<p>
The Team is responsible for estimating and delivering the product
to the customer, adapting its process and practices as it needs,
ensuring the quality of its product and identifying problems and
addressing them as they arise.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf077daf" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgf077daf">Product Owner</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf077daf">
<p>
The Product Owner is responsible for representing the customer,
maintaining the backlog, prioritising User Stories.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgb969716" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgb969716">Scrummaster</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgb969716">
<p>
The Scrummaster is responsible for coaching and encouraging agile
thinking, unblocking the team of external impediments.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5ff4a0a" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org5ff4a0a">Artefacts</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5ff4a0a">
<p>
The four main artefacts in Scrum are as follows:
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgb7331b2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgb7331b2">Product Backlog</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgb7331b2">
<p>
The Product Backlog contains a prioritised and estimated list of
all functionality required by the user. Low Priority stories are
often coarse grained and undetailed in their nature and are often
referred to as Epics. As the story moves up in priority it often
needs to be broken up into smaller chunks so the resulting high
priority items are fine grained and take minimal effort to
complete. This is one of the essential components of scrum. Scrum
cannot really happen in any sense without it, it is important that
it is maintained in terms of estimates and prioritisation.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org076eb1b" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org076eb1b">Release Burndown Chart</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org076eb1b">
<p>
The Release Burndown Chart is a graph of progress through the
backlog showing the total Effort left in the backlog at the end of
each sprint. An example of a release burndown chart is shown
below. The graph shows a reducing value that can be used to
predict the release date.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="grafx-burndown-chart-example.jpg" alt="grafx-burndown-chart-example.jpg" />
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgeda4b84" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgeda4b84">Sprint Backlog</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgeda4b84">

The Sprint Backlog is similar to the Product Backlog but just the
work committed by the Team for the current Sprint. This is usually
split down into Tasks which have an associated estimated work
remaining updated daily.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orga879294">
<p>
At sprint planning, the Team decides how much capacity they have
for the next sprint, based on their previous Sprints’
Velocities. The Product Owner also decides on a goal for the
Sprint. The Team then goes through the backlog with the PO,
ensuring User Acceptance Criteria are up to date and estimates are
correct, and commit to User Stories until the effort required to
complete them matches their expected Velocity. This list is the
Sprint Backlog.
</p>

<p>
The User Stories on the Sprint Backlog can then be split down into
individual tasks and the remaining work estimated. Once the total
remaining work has been estimated and both Team and Product owner
are happy with the Sprint Backlog, the Team commits to doing the
work in the Sprint and the remaining work value used as a starting
point for the Sprint Burndown Chart.

<p>
The sprint is when the work is carried out by the Team. The Sprint
Burndown Chart can be used to monitor progress as the remaining
work is reduced on a daily basis or more frequently. The Sprint
backlog is fixed for the duration of the sprint and the Team gets
on with the work, ensuring integrity and quality of the product
they are producing.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org01fab91">
<p>
At a fixed time every day of the Sprint, usually first thing in
the morning, the team gets together for a quick stand-up
face-to-face meeting to inform each other of yesterday’s progress,
today’s tasks and any impediments that are blocking their progress
on a particular task or story. The Daily Scrum is a very important
part of scrum. It encourages communication, allows the team to
identify issues early and impediments cleared as and when they
happen.

<h4 id="orgaeb318b">Sprint Review</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgaeb318b">
<p>
The purpose of the sprint review is for the Team to demo the User
Stories to the Product Owner and any other potential users or user
representatives. The Product Owner can try out the features, ask
questions and possibly formulate new User Stories for scenarios
not covered by the original User Acceptance Criteria. Once the
Product Owner is satisfied that a User Story is complete, they
mark the User Story as done and remove it from the backlog.
</p>

<p>
Once all User Stories are demo’d and marked as done or otherwise,
the total effort for those User Stories is recorded as the Team’s
Velocity for the Sprint.

After the Sprint Review the team carries out a Retrospective on
the previous sprint, possibly including feedback from the Sprint
Review. The retrospective can take many forms, but typically
involves analysing good and bad things that are happening within
the Team, Process etc. and identifying actions to resolve them.

<h2 id="org6190991">Applying Scrum Principles and Practices to your Project</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org6190991">
<p>
While some scrum practitioners are quite strict in their approach to
applying scrum, I believe it is up to the team to determine how best
to apply scrum to their project. I have put together some thoughts
based on my experience as to when the items above are essential,
eneficial, unnecessary or sometimes a hindrance.
</p>

<p>
If you make choices based on my experience, only time and your
experience will tell whether they were the right ones. Therefore it
may be appropriate to adopt the whole of scrum and then use the
Retrospective to adapt the process as needed.

<h4 id="org900010d">Product Owner</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org900010d">
<p>
The product owner is the human interface to your users. This role
is essential if you want to truly capture your users’ needs. It is
possible that a single person could fulfil 2 roles, Product Owner
and Scrummaster, although there will be a risk of encouraging the
ompromising of agile and lean principles by that one person as
they will be occupying 2 roles where conflicting interests may
need to be resolved.
</p>

<p>
I would always recommend that for any development, even for a Team
of 1, the Product Owner should be outside the team.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org85e1e98" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org85e1e98">Team</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org85e1e98">
<p>
It goes without saying that the team is essential, otherwise the
work will just not be done. Ideally the team should have members
that are multi-disciplined engineers, although this is not always
possible. However the team should always have within it all the
capability to design, develop and fully test User Stories and the
product to a point where the Product Owner can agree to the User
Story being done.
</p>

<p>
The ideal team size is said to be around 8 members. Much more than
this will start to get difficult, but many principles can still be
applied. The more people there are in a team, the more amplified
the difference of opinion may become, also the amount of work in
progress for the team as a whole increases meaning they will have
to keep a closer eye on in sprint progress.
</p>

<p>
Smaller teams however have different problems. It is more affected
by external distraction and often can be difficult to maintain a
predictable velocity. The constant production of a Sprint Backlog
that is rarely completed each sprint can be a real discouragement,
especially to a small team starting out with scrum. Often at this
time it is very important for the team to analyse the way that its
working and adapt scrum to reduce the amount of wasted time.

<div id="outline-container-org2fa0de0" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org2fa0de0">Scrummaster</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org2fa0de0">
<p>
The scrummaster is an interesting role. Many people say that if a
team is mature, understands scrum fully, is thinking in an agile
and lean manner, then it shouldn’t need a scrummaster. The
scrummaster generally acts as a coach and mentor, so is important
for any team starting with scrum. Some teams even rotate the role
of Scrummaster each sprint so everyone gets a chance to learn
about applying scrum.
</p>

<p>
I would suggest that for teams of more than 1 then the role is
needed, especially on start-up. Only when a team and product is
mature is a scrummaster no longer needed, although even that is
debatable, as the scrummaster often brings more benefits than just
coaching

<h4 id="org49459ac">Product Backlog</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org49459ac">
<p>
The product backlog is essential, it defines the product, it
defines the future of the product, it is the basis for estimating,
prioritising and planning. The whole backlog should be prioritised
and estimated, with regular ‘grooming’ sessions to ensure that it
reflects priorities and expectations.
</p>

<p>
You cannot do scrum without a product backlog.

<p>
The release burndown chart is just a means of visualising the
Product Backlog; it is a means to an end. When used alongside the
Product Backlog, the Release Burndown Chart can be used to assist
planning and strategy.
</p>

<p>
How you visualise the progress through the backlog is up to you. I
would suggest a Release Burndown Chart as a starting
point. Cumulative Flow Diagrams are also very useful for
identifying lead times and bottlenecks, based on the change of
work In progress and are a good substitute for Release Burndown
Charts.

<h4 id="org531c954">Sprint Backlog</h4>

<p>
The sprint backlog is a means of batching up work and tracking
small incremental batches of work. For a large team I would
suggest that in order for inspecting efficiency and tracking
progress then this is an essential item
</p>

<p>
However, for small teams that have an unpredictable velocity the
generation of the Sprint Backlog during Sprint Planning can be a
frustrating experience. Perhaps working directly from the Product
Backlog is more appropriate. Inspection of metrics gleaned from
the changing state of the Product Backlog may be more appropriate
in improving efficiency and tracking progress than a Sprint
Backlog.

Much like the Release Burndown Chart, the Sprint Burndown Chart is
just a means of visualising the progress through the Sprint

Sprint Backlog is present, then a Sprint Burndown Chart is
essential.

The first thing I would say that presuming there is more than 1

minimum) then these events are all necessary, how they are carried
out depends very much on how the artefacts are being used. I have
included some notes on each event.

Sprint planning is about just that, planning the Sprint. A goal
should always be set for the sprint by the Product Owner; an
expected target should also be set on the Product Backlog, based
on the Velocity.
</p>

<p>
Whether a Sprint backlog should be used was mentioned briefly
earlier.

The Sprint Planning meeting is often a good opportunity for some
Product Backlog grooming in terms of estimating and prioritising.

The Daily scrum is there to encourage communication and keep
everyone up to date. It requires minimal effort for small teams;
it can even be done remotely if needed, although a lot of
practitioners would discourage this.

<p>
The sprint review is necessary to check that the work in the
sprint backlog has been done. If you are adopting a more pipeline
approach, just taking work directly from the product backlog, then
it may be more appropriate for the Product Owner to review each
User Story as the team completes them. That way, work in progress
is also kept to a minimum.

<p>
Inspect and Adapt is an essential principle of scrum. It is
important that you determine ways and means of analysing what’s
going well and badly as a Team and the Retrospective is the best
point at which to do this. As a 1 member team it is just as
appropriate to carry out a retrospective yourself at the end of a
sprint and record actions in order to improve the efficiency of
the way you work.
