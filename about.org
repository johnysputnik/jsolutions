#+TITLE: About Me
  
  My name is John Cumming, I live in Gloucester with my wife and son
  and have been working in software engineering since 1996. 

  My passion is getting teams working well, delivering measurable solutions to
  validated problems. I strive to encourage all individuals to act as change
  agents within their organisation. I love to see people successful.
  
  My background is software engineering having been involved with a variety of
  products, platforms and technologies as researcher, engineer, architect,
  consultant and team lead. 

  I have been responsible for creating, contributing and advising on many high
  quality, pragmatic solutions to a wide variety of software related challenges.

  I love embracing the unknown and work best in startup type environments. I am
  always looking to push myself and learn through new challenges.
